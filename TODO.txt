The idea here is that the WebUI can launch a page / program on the ESP32 wherein...

The program will pull the index file, give you boxes to check then pull the lists from the matching playlists...

ie. if you check "Classical" then the program will pull all stations from the file Classical.

The program will then check for duplicate addresses and if they already exist, do not add that one.

Optionally, the program will then check if that station is usable, ie if latency is good or not...

I'm also thinking that perhaps you can select an option in the WebUI that if the station has trouble playing (detectable by button push or automatic),
it will be added to a greylist...

Stations on the greylist will have a certain number of "chances" in a certain time-frame.
If they fail those chances, they will automatically be deleted from the internal playlist.
